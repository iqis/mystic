The Mystic Seer is a machine that answers yes/no questions.    
It is very helpful for common decision making scenarios, especially in the ourskirts of Twilight Zone.

_a typical use case_


## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iqis/mystic")
```
## Ask the Mystic a Question

You may summon the Mystic Seer whenever necessary.    
It is, however, recommended that you keep `mystic` attached and ready for use in every R session.

```{r }
require(mystic)
```

You may then proceed to `ask()` a yes/no question...

```{r}
ask("Can I trust your advice?")
```

... in any language.

```{r}
ask("我们今天能离开这个地方吗？")
```

Try the Mystic Seer today, and see how your life gets easier!
